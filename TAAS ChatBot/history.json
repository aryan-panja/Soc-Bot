Evolution of galaxies is known to be affected by various processes. In this work we studied the long term effects on the evolution of disc galaxies when it passes through the intergalactic medium (IGM), in particular the effect on the gas component of the disc. Ram pressure stripping (RPS) of gas from the disc as it passes through the IGM, is known to be the dominant process to remove gas from the discs. However a systematic study of such system was lacking. We propose a model for RPS on galaxy evolution and address the questions like: how gas is stripped as it passes through the intergalactic medium, what are its effects on the evolution of star formation rate and the effect of RPS as a function of galaxy mass.\nFunding Agency/Amount: Science and Engineering Research Board (DST)/INR 19.2 Lac.\nDescription of Research Interests:\nHer research interests mainly lies in Gravitational dynamics.
